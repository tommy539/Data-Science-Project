PDF, one of the famous formats of documents, at the same time it is also a nightmare to us while we want to convert them into text format. They look like usual documents when we read them. However, they feel like pictures when we need to edit or convert them into text.

This project firstly provides a way to parse read these notorious pdf files and convert them into text format. Around 850 resumes are used to illustrate the pdf parsing. After the conversion, basic NLP (natural language processing) is used to investigate what is the most common topics/skills are included among the resumes.

Data for this study is one of the resources from my master degree at Monash University. The data is a huge set of resume in pdf format, same as those we have seen in our daily live or online. Therefore, any resumes can also be used in this project.
This project is useful for those who need to handle a huge amount of text information such as HR handling more than 200 resumes, researchers studying linguistics, artificial intelligence to learn languages and so on.
